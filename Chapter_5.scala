// Exercise 8
// Note: Could do this with all four as inputs to class, but I wanted to make it flexible enough to handle adding License Plate
// without adding a Model Year (slightly changes question, though, since then modelYear needs to have both get/set)

// Exercise 10
class Employee(val name: String = "John Q. Public", var salary: Double = 0.0){
  override def toString = "Employee: %s, Salary: %f".format(name, salary)
}
// Answer = this is cleaner and more flexible, in my opinion, as it allows user to enter name, but not salary
